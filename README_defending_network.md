# Defending the Network from a Simulated Attack

**Author:** John Tucker

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a full incident response workflow using a simulated cyberattack environment. The objective was to identify, exploit, defend, and patch vulnerable systems using real-world tools such as Infection Monkey and Metasploit, followed by antivirus remediation and perimeter hardening.

The exercise focused on understanding how an attacker gains access to a network, how infections propagate, and how defenders can contain, remove, and prevent further compromise.

---

## Objectives
- Perform a simulated attack on a vulnerable web server using Infection Monkey.  
- Analyze exploit results and identify system weaknesses.  
- Use antivirus software to remove malicious files and restore system integrity.  
- Recreate a targeted exploit using Metasploit to simulate post-exploitation activities.  
- Patch and verify the vulnerability fix.  
- Harden the firewall to reduce attack surface.  
- Confirm mitigation success through additional exploit attempts and antivirus scans.

## Procedure Summary

### 1. Simulated Attack
- Deployed Infection Monkey from MonkeyIsland to scan and exploit a web server (corporationtechs.com).
- Observed infection spread, confirmed the compromise, and reviewed the toolâ€™s mitigation recommendations.

### 2. Malware Containment and Removal
- Identified infected files within the VIRUS directory.  
- Executed antivirus scans to isolate and delete malicious payloads.  
- Verified system health post-remediation.

### 3. Exploitation with Metasploit
- Configured and executed a targeted exploit on a Linux web server.  
- Achieved a remote shell session, confirming successful exploitation.  
- Captured exploit details and post-exploitation activities.

### 4. Patch and Verification
- Checked Bash version before and after patching.  
- Attempted the exploit again after the update and verified that it failed, confirming successful mitigation.

### 5. Perimeter Hardening
- Reviewed and updated firewall rules on the DMZ interface within pfSense.  
- Performed an antivirus scan on the workstation using Windows Defender, confirming detection of test malware (EICAR file).
